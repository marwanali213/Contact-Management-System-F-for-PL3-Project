# Contact-Management-System-F-for-PL3-Project

Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

**Added the files that contain the core functions and the GUI. You must run it on .NET 7 and ensure that the Windows Forms package is installed before running the code. You can Google the commands required to run the project; they are fairly easy (e.g., `dotnet run`).**

**Additional functionalities and features that could be added to the project to improve it (prioritized from most to least):**
1. Saving and loading data from local files.
2. Displaying contacts in a tabular format.
3. Enhancing the GUI (I found the GUI acceptable, but if anyone wants to improve its appearance, that would be nice).

*** Chose and push files to the other public repo that i will provide it here soon ***
